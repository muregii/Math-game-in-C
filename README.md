# Math-game-in-C
A game that will help primary school children practice with arithmetic. The program should have a menu that the learner will choose what operation they want to practice with (Addition, subtraction, division and multiplication). The learner should be able to choose the level he wants to play with. (Low level has numbers between 1-10, mid-level has numbers between 11-50 and high level has numbers between 51-100). Once the learner chooses the levels, and the operation to practice with, the program should generate two random numbers for the learner to give an answer to the operation selected. If the answer is correct the learner earns a 1 point. If the answer is wrong the program should display the correct answer to the learner. The program should enable the learner play as many times as they wish. When the learner has finished playing, the program should be able to display the total points earned.    Hint: Use the rand() function to generate the numbers. Attached is a file demonstrating the use of the rand() function.
